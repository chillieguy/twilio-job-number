# TWILIO voice and sms project
A python app to interact through sms with response choices or to call and be connected with Chuck.

## Thank you
The Twilio docs and Youtube channel were invaluable in troubleshooting.  I also refered to [twilio.radicalskills.com](twilio.radicalskills.com) for inspiration.  I will be following the tutorial for more practice.

## TO DO - Possibilities
* Get senders location and send a weather report
* Implement a conference call to connect multiple callers
* Add a menu during the initial call to be connected or send sms
